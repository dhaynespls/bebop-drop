In this project, you will write a program to gain control of a flying Bebop
drone that is being operated by some other controller.

Your program should work as automatically as possible.

Your program should work both against your developed controller as well as the
regular controller and FreeFlight Pro.

Chosen attack method: Launch a MITM attack on the controller and the drone.
